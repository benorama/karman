Since Karman ships with the @LocalStorageProvider@. It also provides mappings for fetching files from this store. This can be configured with the following options:

{code}
grailsApplication.config.grails.plugins.karman {
	serveLocalStorage = true 
	serveLocalMapping = 'storage' // means /storage is base path
	storagePath = '/path/to/filestore'
}
{code}
